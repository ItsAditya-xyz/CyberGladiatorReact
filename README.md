each nft has a timestamp of 24 hr plus. 
at mint/posthashhex -> each user does safe burn of 25 to make a bid -> user bids (we take their derived key) -> we make comment on post that stores all bid info of in comment ->
after 24 hours it's decided. -> winnner's nft gets burn -> in a databse by doing cron job of a public key we store stuff their -> rest people get their 23 nfts back and all get royalty collectively.
